## Project Description
University cafeteria is 5 min walking distance from hostel. Some restaurants of the Cafeteria provide delivery service to the hostel. A lot of misunderstandings between restaurants and customers are happening when orders are provided just by phone. The delivery method is not efficient.
The cafeteria is overly crowded during lunch time(around 12 pm).

Besides, I also wanted to create a platform where students can trade their accessories among their classmates. They can open their restaurants in this web app alongside with official restaurants from university cafeteria.

I started this project from scratch by myself. It initially use React Context + Reducer as a state management system. After first release, I refactored it to Redux Toolkit.
